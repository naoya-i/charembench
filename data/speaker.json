You might as well ask me if I sympathise with a storm or with an earthquake , or with a river running to the sea . Perhaps I do . But perhaps I do not . That has no importance . Feminism is a natural phenomenon ; it was unavoidable . You Englishwomen will get your vote . Even we in France will get it one day . It can not be denied ... . Sympathy is not required . But let us suppose that all women joined the struggle . What would happen to women ? What would happen to the world ? Just as nunneries were a necessity of other ages , so even in this age women must meditate . Far more than men they need to understand themselves . Until they understand themselves how can they understand men ? The function of women is to understand . Their function is also to preserve . All the beautiful and luxurious things in the world are in the custody of women . Men would never of themselves keep a tradition . If there is anything on earth worth keeping , women must keep it . And the tradition will be lost if every woman listens to Madame Rosamund . That is what she can not see . Her genius blinds her . You say I am a friend of Madame Rosamund . I am . Madame Rosamund was educated in Paris , at the same school as my aunt and myself . But I have never helped her in her mission . And I never will . My vocation is elsewhere . When she fled over here from the English police , she came to me . I received her . She asked me to drive her to certain addresses . I did so . She was my guest . I surrounded her with all that she had abandoned , all that her genius had forced her to abandon . But I never spoke to her of her work , nor she to me of it . Still , I dare to think that I was of some value to the woman in Madame Rosamund . \"",

We worked till twelve , and then in the afternoon we went to school . The next day we went to school in the morning and to the mill in the afternoon . When we were thirteen we left school altogether , and worked twelve hours a day in the mill . In the evenings we had to do housework . In fact , all our housework was done before half - past five in the morning and after half - past six in the evening . We had to work just as hard as the men and boys in the mill . We got a great deal less money and a great deal less decent treatment ; but to make up we had to slave in the early morning and late at night , while the men either snored or smoked . I was all right . But Susan was n't . And a lot of women were n't , especially young mothers with babies . So I learnt typewriting on the quiet , and left it all to try and find out whether something could n't be done . I soon found out -- after I 'd heard Rosamund speak . That 's the reason I 'm not mending stockings . I 'm not blaming anybody . It 's no one 's fault , really . It certainly is n't men 's fault .

      "text": "\" It was after that Liberal mass meeting in Peel Park , at Bradford . I 'd begun to ask questions , as usual , you know -- questions they ca n't answer -- and then some Liberal stewards , with lovely rosettes in their buttonholes , came round me and started cutting my coat with their penknives . They cut it all to pieces . You see that was the best argument they could think of in the excitement of the moment . I believe they 'd have cut up every stitch I had , only perhaps it began to dawn on them that it might be awkward for them . Then two of them lifted me up , one by the feet and the other by the shoulders , and carried me off . They would n't let me walk . I told them they 'd hurt my leg , but they were too busy to listen . As soon as they came across a policeman they said they had done it all to save me from being thrown into the lake by a brutal and infuriated mob . I just had enough breath left to thank them . Of course , the police were n't going to stand that , so I was taken that night to London . Everything was thought of except my tea . But I expect they forgot that on purpose so that I should be properly hungry when I got to Holloway . However , I said to myself , ' If I ca n't eat and drink when _ I _ want , I wo n't eat and drink when _ they _ want ! ' And I did n't . \" After I 'd paid my respects at Bow Street , and was back at Holloway , I just stamped on everything they offered me , and wrote a petition to the Governor asking to be treated as a political prisoner . Instead of granting the petition he kept sending me more and more beautiful food , and I kept stamping on it . Then three magistrates arrived and sat on my case , and sentenced me to the punishment cells . They ran off as soon as they 'd sentenced me . I said I would n't go to their punishment cells . I told everybody again how lame I was . So five wardresses carried me there , but they dropped me twice on the way . It was a very interesting cell , the punishment cell was . If it had been in the Tower , everybody would go to look at it because of its quaintness . There were two pools of water near to the bed . I was three days in the cell , and those pools of water were always there ; I could see them because from where I lay on the bed the light glinted on them . Just one gleam from the tiny cobwebby window high up . I had n't anything to read , of course , but even if I 'd had something I could n't see to read . The bed was two planks , just raised an inch or two above the water , and the pillow was wooden . Never any trouble about making beds like that ! The entire furniture of this cosy drawing - room was -- you 'll never guess -- a tree - stump , meant for a chair , I think . And on this tree - stump was an india - rubber cup . I could just see it across the cell . \" At night the wardresses were struck with pity , or perhaps it was the Governor . Anyhow , they brought me a mattress and a rug . They told me to get up off the bed , and I told them I could n't get up , could n't even turn over . So they said , ' Very well , then ; you can do without these things , ' and they took them away . The funny thing was that I really could n't get up . If I tried to move , my leg made me want to shriek . \" After three days they decided to take me to the prison hospital . I shrieked all the way -- could n't help it . They laughed . So then I laughed . In the hospital , the doctor decided that my left ankle was sprained and my right thigh broken . So I had the best of them , after all . They had to admit they were wrong . It was most awkward for them . Then I thought I might as well begin to eat . But they had to be very careful what they gave me . I had n't had anything for nearly six days , you see . They were in a fearful stew . Doctor was there day and night . And it was n't his fault . I told him he had all my sympathies . He said he was very sorry I should be lame for life , but it could n't be helped , as the thigh had been left too long . I said , ' Please do n't mention it .

      "text": "\" I asked that question to see what you thought about it . I , myself , do not fancy they are bad -- all of them . It is simply a case of folly . There is a certain glamour about an actor that robes him with false attractions for light - headed young girls . It makes the most commonplace fellows seem like heroes . No . I do not think all girls who flirt with actors are bad , but I do think they are foolish . It is quite likely they would turn in scorn and repugnance from the very fellows who seem so much like heroes to them could they know the truth about those same heroes . When a theatrical company comes into a place , the girls will turn in many cases from the respectable , honest young men whom they know , and smile and flirt with the members of the company , who are utter strangers to them . In this manner they often acquire undesirable reputations without going to the extreme of doing anything seriously bad . But when a girl injures her reputation in such a manner it is pretty hard for her to win back the ground she has lost . She is regarded with suspicion , she has become a theme of gossip and perhaps she is startled to find that the young men she knows , who have always been polite and respectful , have suddenly grown familiar and forward in their manners toward her . She does not understand this , but she is entirely to blame for it . It is but natural for a young man to think there is something wrong about a girl who will flirt with a strange actor . It is but natural for him to lose in a certain measure his respect for such a girl and become free and easy in his treatment of her . He sees no reason why he can not be that way if she will laugh and talk with an actor -- a man of whom she knows absolutely nothing . \"",

In the first place , are any of you troubled with the _ ascites _ , or dropsy , which , as the celebrated Galen hath declared , may be divided into three parts , the _ ascites _ , the _ anasarca _ , and the _ tympanites _ . The diagnostics of this disease are , swelling of the abdomen or stomach , difficulty of breathing , want of appetite , and a teazing cough . I say , have any of you this disease ? None . Then I thank Heaven that you are not so afflicted . \" The next disease it is good for , is the _ peripneumonia _ , or inflammation on the lungs -- the diagnostics or symptoms of which are , a small pulse , swelling of the eyes , and redness of the face . Say , have any of you these symptoms -- if so , you have the disease . No one . I thank Heaven that you are none of you so afflicted . \" It is also a sovereign remedy for the _ diarrhoea _ , the diagnostics of which are , faintness , frequent gripings , rumbling in the bowels , cold sweats , and spasm . \"",

He hath used the chopsticks with the Chinese , swung the Cherok pooga with the Hindoos , and put a new nose on the Great Cham of Tartary . He hath visited and been received in every court of Europe : danced on the ice of the Neva with the Russians -- led the mazurka with the Poles -- waltzed with the Germans -- tarantulaed with the Italians -- fandangoed with the Spanish -- and quadrilled with the French . He hath explored every mine in the universe , walked through every town on the Continent , examined every mountain in the world , ascended Mont Blanc , walked down the Andes , and run up the Pyrenees . He has been into every volcano in the globe , and descending by Vesuvius has been thrown up by Stromboli . He has lived more than a thousand years , and is still in the flower of his youth . He has had one hundred and forty sets of teeth one after another , and expects a new set next Christmas . His whole life has been spent in the service of mankind , and in doing good to his fellow - creatures ; and having the experience of more than a thousand years , he cures more than a thousand diseases . Gentlemen , the wonderful doctor will present himself before you this evening , and will then tell you what his remedies are good for , so that you may pick and choose according to your several complaints . Ladies , the wonderful doctor can greatly assist you : he has secrets by which you may have a family if you should so wish -- philters to make husbands constant , and salve to make them blind -- cosmetics to remove pimples and restore to youth and beauty , and powders to keep children from squalling .

It was thus that I formed an acquaintance with Lady de Clare and her daughter , whose early history , as Fleta , I had obtained from you , but who , I little imagined to be the little girl that you had so generously protected ; for it was not until after I had deserted you , that you had discovered her parentage . The extreme interest relative to you evinced by both the mother and the daughter surprised me . They had heard of my name from you , but not of our quarrel . They urged me , and thanked me for proposing to follow you and find you out : I did make every attempt . I went to Brentford , inquired at all the public - houses , and of all the coachmen who went down the road , but could obtain no information , except that at one public - house a gentleman stopped with a portmanteau , and soon afterwards went away with it on his shoulders . I returned to Richmond with the tidings of my ill - success about a week after I had first called there . Cecilia was much affected , and cried very bitterly . I could not help asking Lady de Clare why she took such a strong interest in your fortunes . ` Who ought , ' replied Cecilia , ` if his poor Fleta does not ? ' ` Good Heavens ! Miss de Clare , are you the little Fleta whom he found with the gipsies , and talked to me so much about ? ' ` Did you not know it ? ' said Lady de Clare . I then explained to her all that had latterly passed between us , and they in return communicated your events and dangers in Ireland . Thus was an intimacy formed , and ever since I have been constantly welcome at their house . I did not , however , abandon my inquiries for many months , when I thought it was useless , and I had to console poor Cecilia , who constantly mourned for you . And now , Japhet , I must make my story short : I could not help admiring a young person who showed so much attachment and gratitude joined to such personal attractions ; but she was an heiress , and I was a younger brother . Still Lady de Clare insisted upon my coming to the house ; and I was undecided how to act , when the unfortunate death of my elder brother put me in a situation to aspire to her hand . After that my visits were more frequent ; and I was tacitly received as a suitor by Lady de Clare , and had no reason to complain of the treatment I received from Cecilia . Such was the position of affairs until the day on which you broke in upon us so unexpectedly ; and at the very moment that you came in , I had , with the sanction of her mother , made an offer to Cecilia , and was anxiously awaiting an answer from her own dear lips . Can you , therefore , be surprised , Japhet , at there being a degree of constraint on all sides at the interruption occasioned by the presence of one who had long been considered lost to us ? Or that a young person just deciding upon the most important step of her life should feel confused and agitated at the entrance of a third party , however dear he might be to her as a brother and benefactor ? \"",

However , after receiving a very fair share of abuse from the old woman , and a plaster of hot greens in my face -- for she went supperless to bed , rather than not have her revenge -- I walked back to the inn , and sat down in the tap . The two men next to me were hawkers ; one carried a large pack of dimities and calicoes , and the other a box full of combs , needles , tapes , scissors , knives , and mock - gold trinkets . I entered into conversation with them , and , as I again stood treat , I soon was very intimate . They told me what their profits were , and how they contrived to get on , and I thought , for a rambling life , it was by no means an unpleasant one ; so having obtained all the information I required , I went back to town , took out a hawker 's licence , for which I paid two guineas , and purchasing at a shop , to which they gave me a direction , a pretty fair quantity of articles in the tape and scissor line , off I set once more on my travels . I took the north road this time , and picked up a very comfortable subsistence , selling my goods for a few halfpence here , and a few halfpence there , at the cottages as I passed by ; but I soon found out , that without a newspaper I was not a confirmed hawker , and the more radical the newspaper the better . A newspaper will pay half the expenses of a hawker , if he can read . At every house , particularly every small hedge alehouse , he is received , and placed in the best corner of the chimney , and has his board and lodging , with the exception of what he drinks , gratis , if he will pull out the newspaper and read it to those around him who can not read , particularly if he can explain what is unintelligible . Now I became a great politician , and , moreover , a great radical , for such were the politics of all the lower classes . I lived well , slept well , and sold my wares very fast . I did not take more than three shillings in the day , yet , as two out of the three were clear profit , I did pretty well .

If they had not forgiven her , and made up their resolutions to do a kind thing for her , then B. would have run away when she saw Dolly , and not waited to speak to her and give the banana , and so nobody might have known that Dolly was sick , and she might have died without knowing about Jesus , who died for her ; but she never knew it till Bessie told her . And , oh , how dreadful that would have been for M. and B. Happy ! but God was so good as to spare them of it , and Dolly learned about Jesus , and loved Him , and wanted to please Him , only she did not have much time ; but Jesus does not care about that , so long as she believed on Him , and loved Him , and He took Dolly away to His own heaven to live with Him . And M. and B. Happy were happy about it , even if Dolly was dead , because papa and mamma , and all our grown - up , wise people , think she is happy with Jesus ; and we hope our Father will let it be a little jewel to carry to Him , when the angel takes us over the river , and the Elder Brother will say we did it unto Him , because we did it to His poor little lamb that did not know about Him . And now M. and B. Happy do not mind so much about the gardens , even though they ca n't try for a prize , and B. says she had rather have Dolly 's little marigold than the prettiest prize that ever was , but I am afraid M. would not ; but then , you see , she is not so very perfect as B. , and besides I do n't like the smell of the marigolds : I think it 's awful . And God let M. have a very happy dream . M. knows it is foolish to think much about dreams , because they are not a bit of consequence , and she hopes any one who reads this will not think she was so foolish as to believe any thing about it ; but it did make her feel a little glad about it , and B. liked it too . The dream was this : I was out by the lake with Bessie , but it was the night , and oh ! there were so very many stars , and Dolly 's little bed was out by the lake too , and she was in it , quite alive . And we heard voices all around , but we could not see where they came from ; but we knew it was the angels , and they were calling to Dolly , and she came out of her bed , and tried to go , but she could not , because she had no wings . Then such a beautiful thing happened , -- the stars came down out of the sky , and fixed themselves down to the ground where Dolly stood , and she went up , up , up on them , just as if they were steps , to heaven . And when she stepped over each one , it went right back to its place in the sky ; but it left a long light behind it , like the shooting star we saw the other night ; and at the top of the stair of stars was a soft , white cloud ; and when Dolly came to it , a hand came out of the cloud , and took her in , and we knew she was quite safe , and would never come back again . But for all I was glad M. cried , and dear mamma came and woke her up , and asked me why I cried , and kissed me , and I told her I was glad Dolly went to heaven , because she had no precious mamma to kiss and love her , or to tell her troubles and happinesses to . So it was a very happy , grateful thing , all about Dolly . \"",

One night when the wicked chief was returning from the hunt , he saw , as he thought , in the dim moonlight , his brother sitting in his usual place . This was very near the edge of the rock , where a slight push might throw him over , and it came into the bad man 's heart to climb up softly behind him , and , with a sudden shove , to send him down upon the rocks below . He gave himself no time to think , and in a few moments he had reached the quiet figure which was half concealed by a clump of trees , and , with a push of his powerful hand , sent it whirling over into the valley below . \"",

You stupid ass , do you think I cared about what _ you _ could find out ? I am in such perpetual terror of being forestalled by my colleagues , that I am not master of myself , even when such eyes as yours look at my work . In a month or two more -- perhaps in a week or two -- I shall have solved the grand problem . I labour at it all day . I think of it , I dream of it , all night . It will kill me . Strong as I am , it will kill me . What do you say ? Am I working myself into my grave , in the medical interests of humanity ? _ That _ for humanity ! I am working for my own satisfaction -- for my own pride -- for my own unutterable pleasure in beating other men -- for the fame that will keep my name living hundreds of years hence . Humanity ! I say with my foreign brethren -- Knowledge for its own sake , is the one god I worship . Knowledge is its own justification and its own reward . The roaring mob follows us with its cry of Cruelty . We pity their ignorance . Knowledge sanctifies cruelty . The old anatomist stole dead bodies for Knowledge . In that sacred cause , if I could steal a living man without being found out , I would tie him on my table , and grasp my grand discovery in days , instead of months . Where are you going ? What ? You 're afraid to be in the same room with me ? A man who can talk as I do , is a man who would stick at nothing ? Is that the light in which you lower order of creatures look at us ? Look a little higher -- and you will see that a man who talks as I do is a man set above you by Knowledge . Exert yourself , and try to understand me . Have I no virtues , even from your point of view ? Am I not a good citizen ? Do n't I pay my debts ? Do n't I serve my friends ? You miserable creature , you have had my money when you wanted it ! Look at that letter on the floor . The man mentioned in it is one of those colleagues whom I distrust . I did my duty by him for all that . I gave him the information he wanted ; I introduced him to a friend in a land of strangers . Have I no feeling , as you call it ? My last experiments on a monkey horrified me . His cries of suffering , his gestures of entreaty , were like the cries and gestures of a child . I would have given the world to put him out of his misery . But I went on .

Then we came to Manator instead , she taking a new name and I the name A-Sor , that we might not be traced through our names .

My father had a big family that kept him poor , and I was a tinsmith with little work to be had in the village where we lived . So I started west , working my way from town to town , until I got to Portland , Oregon . \" There was work in plenty there , making the tin cans in which salmon and other fish is packed , and as I was industrious I soon had a shop of my own , and supplied cans to the packers . The shop grew to be a great factory , employing hundreds of men . Then I bought up the factories of my competitors , so as to control the market , and as I used so much tin - plate I became interested in the manufacture of this product , and invested a good deal of money in the production and perfection of American tin . My factories were now scattered all along the coast , even to California , where I made the cans for the great quantities of canned fruits they ship from that section every year . Of course the business made me rich , and I bought real estate with my extra money , and doubled my fortune again and again . \" I never married , for all my heart was in the business , and I thought of nothing else . But a while ago a big consolidation of the canning industries was effected , and the active management I resigned to other hands , because I had grown old , and had too much money already . \" It was then that I remembered the family , and went back quietly to the village where I was born . They were all dead or scattered , I found ; but because Jane had inherited a fortune in some way I discovered where she lived and went to see her . I suppose it was because my clothes were old and shabby that Jane concluded I was a poor man and needed assistance ; and I did n't take the trouble to undeceive her . \" I also found my three nieces at Elmhurst , and it struck me it would be a good time to study their characters ; for like Jane I had a fortune to leave behind me , and I was curious to find out which girl was the most deserving . No one suspected my disguise . I do n't usually wear such poor clothes , you know ; but I have grown to be careless of dress in the west , and finding that I was supposed to be a poor man I clung to that old suit like grim death to a grasshopper . \"",

You hardly need to be assured that I too take a deep interest in the intellectual struggles of my countrymen , but an excess of business does not permit me to watch them closely . I am obliged to content myself with such reports as the newspapers furnish . I should like to read Renan 's work , which seems to have created a great sensation . They say it suits our times admirably . \"",

      "text": "\" you will please observe that the doctrine of state supremacy is a step backward of nearly two thousand years . In Nero 's day , but one source of right , namely , the state , was recognized . In the head of the state , the emperor , were centred all power , all authority , and all right . In his person , the state was exalted into a divinity . Temples and altars were reared to the emperor ; sacrifices were offered to him ; he was worshipped as a deity . Even human sacrifices were not denied him if the imperial divinity thought proper to demand them . And , now , to what condition did these monstrous errors bring the world of that period ? It became one vast theatre of crime , immorality , and despotism . Slavery coiled itself about men and things , and strangled their liberty . Matrimonial life sank into the most loathsome corruption . Infanticide was permitted to pass unpunished . The licentiousness of women was even greater than that of men . Life and property became mere playthings for the whims of the emperor and of his courtiers . Did the divine Caesar wish to amuse his deeply sunken subjects , he had only to order the gladiators to butcher one another , or some prisoners or slaves or Christians to be thrown to tigers and panthers ; this made a Roman holiday . Such , gentlemen , was human society when it recognized no supersensible world , no God above , no moral law . If our own progress proceeds much further in the path on which it is marching , it will soon reach a similar fearful stage . We already see in our midst the commencement of social corruption . We have the only source of right proclaimed to be the divine state . Conscience is being tyrannized over by a majority that rejects God and denies future rewards and punishments . All the rest , even to the divine despot , has already followed , or inevitably will follow . Therefore , Mr. Seicht , the progress you so loudly boast of is mere stupid retrogression , blind superstition , which falls prostrate before the majority of a mob , and worships the omnipotence of the state . \"",

In the Thirty Years ' War , when Gustavus Adolphus , the pious hero , passed through the German provinces murdering and robbing , the inhabitants of the neighborhood fled with their wives , children , and property to this remote valley . They imagined themselves hid in these woods and defiles from the wandering Swedes , but they deceived themselves . Their hiding - place was discovered , and every living thing -- Cows , calves , and oxen excepted -- was put to the sword . ' The blood of the massacred , ' said my informer , ' flowed down the valley like a brook ; and for fifty years the neighborhood was desolate , because the Swedes had destroyed every thing . ' Such masterpieces of Swedish blood - thirstiness are found in many places in Germany ; and as the people celebrate them in song and story , it is certain that the pious hero has won for himself imperishable fame in the art of slaughter . \"",

As there is in man a spiritual tendency which raises him far above the visible and material , God has been pleased to lead and direct that tendency by revelation , that man may not err . I consider divine revelation a necessity which God willed when he created the mind . As the mind has an instinctive thirst after truth , God must , by the revelation of truth , satisfy this thirst Therefore is revelation as old as the human race . It reached its completion and perfection by the coming of the Lord , who said , ' I am the truth ; ' and this knowledge of the truth remains in the church through the guidance of the Spirit of truth , till the latest generation . This is only my ultramontane conviction , \"",

Thus , I once read in an old chronicle that the monks during choral service sung with such enchanting sweetness that the empress and her ladies and knights who were present burst into tears . I smiled at this passage from the garrulous old chronicler , and thought that the fabulous spirit of the middle ages had descended into the pen of the good man . How often have I heard Mozart 's divine music , how often have I been entranced by the stormy , thrilling fantasies of Beethoven ! But I was never moved to tears , and I never saw even delicate ladies weep . Two days ago , I wandered alone among the ruins of the abbey of Hagenroth . I stood in the ruined church ; above was the unclouded sky , and high round about me the naked walls . Here and there upon the walls hung patches of plaster , and these were painted . I examined the paintings and found them of remarkable purity and depth of sentiment . I examined the painted columns in the nave and choir , and found a beautiful harmony . I admired the excellence of the colors , on which it has snowed , rained , and frozen for three hundred and twenty years . I then examined the fallen columns , the heavy capitals , the beauty of the ornaments , and from these significant remnants my imagination built up the whole structure , and the church loomed up before me in all its simple grandeur and charming finish . I was forced to recognize and admire those artists who knew how to produce such wonderful and charming effects by such simple combinations . I thought on that passage of the chronicle , and I believe if , at that moment , the simple , pure chant of the monks had echoed through the basilica , I also would have been moved to tears . If the monks knew , thought I , how to captivate and charm by their architecture , why could they not do the same with music ? \"",

It lies next to yours , and you ought not to let the chance slip . ' I wanted the field , but had no money . This I told you . You encouraged me , saying , ' Holt , my good man , I will let you have the money -- on interest , of course ; for I am a man doing business , and I make my living off my money . I will never push you for the amount . You may pay it whenever and in what way you wish . Suit yourself . ' You gave me this encouragement at the time . You loaned me nine hundred and fifty florins -- in the note , however , you wrote one thousand and fifty , and , besides , at five per cent . For three years I paid interest on one thousand and fifty , although you had loaned me only nine hundred and fifty . All of a sudden -- I was just in trouble at the time , for one of my draught - cattle had been crippled , and the harvest had turned out poorly , you came and demanded your money . I had none . ' I am sorry , ' said you , ' I need my money , and could put it out at much higher interest . ' I begged and begged . You threatened to sue me . Finally , after much begging , you proposed that I should sell you the field , for which three years previous I had paid nine hundred and fifty florins , for seven hundred florins , alleging that land was no longer as valuable as it had been . You were willing to rent me the field at a high rate . And to enable me to get along , you offered to lend me another thousand , but drew up a note for eleven hundred florins at ten per cent. , because , as you pretended , money was now bringing ten per cent . since the law regulating interest had been abrogated . For a long while I objected to the proposal , but found myself forced at last to yield because you threatened to attach my effects . From this time I began to go downhill , I could no longer meet expenses , my family was large , and I had to work for you to pay up the interest and rent . But for some time back I had been unable to do as I wished . I could not even sell any of my own property ; for you were holding me fast , and I was obliged to mortgage everything to you for a merely nominal price . My cottage , my barn , my garden , and the field in front of my house -- worth at least two thousand florins -- I had to give you a mortgage upon for one thousand . The rest of my immovable property , fields and meadows , you took . Nothing was left to me but the little hut and what adjoined it . With respects , Mr. Shund , you had long since sucked the very marrow from my bones , next you put the rope about my neck , and now you are about to hang me . \"",

A few dim pictures , however , the last my poor eyes ever beheld , are still engraved upon my memory and visible to my imagination . My father stood with his back to the light , and from the first moment of his entering the room I never saw his face again ; but the countenance of the object of his accusation , illumined as it was by the last rays of the golden sunset , stands ever in the foreground of my recollection . His head was thrown proudly back ; conscious innocence proclaimed itself in his clear , calm eye , which shrunk not from the closest scrutiny ; his hand was clenched , as if he were vainly striving to repress the passion which proclaimed itself in the compressed lips , the set teeth , the deep and angry indignation which overspread his face . He did not speak -- apparently he could not command voice to do so ; but my father continued to upbraid him in language cutting and severe , though I remember not a word of it . It was fearful to watch the working of the young man 's face , while he stood there listening to taunts and enduring reproaches which were believed by him who uttered them to be just and merited , but which wrought the youth to a degree of frenzy which it was terrible to witness . Suddenly he took one step forward , slowly lifted the clenched hand which had hitherto hung at his side . I know not whether he might then have intended to call Heaven to witness his innocence of the crime , or whether he might have designed to strike my father ; for I sprang from my seat prepared to rush between them , and implore them for my sake , to desist ; but my strength failed me , and , with a shriek , I sunk back in a fainting fit . \" Oh , the horror of my awakening ! How shall I find words to tell it ? -- and yet I must ! Listen , Gertrude . He -- the poor , ruined boy -- sprung to help me ; and , maddened by injustice , he knew not what he did . Heaven is my witness , I never blamed him ; and if , in my agony , I uttered words that seemed like a reproach , it was because I was too frantic , and knew not what I said ! \"",

I rushed out , for I thought the fall might have killed the poor little thing ; and Mr. Bray , and a gentleman whom he was waiting upon , followed me . She did appear stunned at first ; but we carried her into the shop and she came to her senses in a minute or two . Crazy you asked if she were , Uncle True ! No , not she ! She 's as bright as you are ! As soon as she opened her eyes , and seemed to know what she was about , she felt for her work - bag and all its appendages ; counted them up , to see if the number were right , and then nodded her head very satisfactorily . Mr. Bray poured out a glass of cordial and offered it to her . By this time she had got her airs and graces back again ; so when he recommended her to swallow the cordial , she retreated with a little old - fashioned curtsey , and put up both her hands to express her horror at the idea of such a thing . The gentleman standing by smiled , and advised her to take it , as it would do her no harm . She turned round , made another curtsey to him , and asked , in a little cracked voice , ' Can you assure me , sir , as a gentleman of candour and gallantry , that it is not an exhilarating potion ? ' The gentleman could hardly keep from laughing ; but he told her it was nothing that would hurt her . ' Then , ' said she , ' I will venture to sip the beverage ; it has most aromatic fragrance . ' She seemed to like the taste as well as the smell , for she drank every drop of it ; she turned to me and said , ' Except upon this gentleman 's assurance of the harmlessness of the liquid , I would not have swallowed it in your presence , my young master , if it were only for the _ example _ . I have set my seal to no temperance pledge , but I am abstemious because it becomes a lady ; it is with me a matter of choice , a matter of _ taste _ . ' She now seemed quite restored , and talked of starting again on her walk ; but it was not safe for her to go alone on the ice , and Mr. Bray thought so , for he asked her where she was going ? She told him , in her roundabout way , that she was going to pass the day with mistress somebody , that lived near the Common . I touched Mr. Bray 's arm , and said , in a low voice , that if he could spare me , I 'd go with her . He said he should n't want me for an hour ; so I offered her my arm and told her I should be happy to wait upon her . You ought to have seen her then . If I had been a grownup man , and she a young lady , she could n't have tossed her head or giggled more . But she took my arm and we started off . I knew Mr. Bray and the gentleman were laughing to see us , but I did n't care ; I pitied the old lady , and I did not mean she should get another tumble . \" Every person we met stared at us ; we were such a grotesque looking couple . She accepted my proffered arm , and clasped her hands together round it , making a complete handle of her two arms ; and so she hung on with all her might . But I ought not to laugh at the poor thing , for she needed somebody to help her along , and I 'm sure she was n't heavy enough to tire me out , if she did make the most of herself . I wonder who she belongs to . I should n't think her friends would let her go about the streets so , especially such walking as it is to - day . \"",

I did employ every argument to dissuade her from her purpose ; and when my eloquence had failed to induce the abandonment of the scheme , I availed myself of every suggestion and motive which possibly might influence her to shorten her absence . Not because the society of the selfish girl was essential , or even conducive , to my happiness -- far from it -- but because her excellent father , who so worshipped and idolized his only child that he would have thought no sacrifice too great to promote her enjoyment , was at the very time , amid all the discomfort of a crowded watering - place , hovering between life and death , and I was disgusted at the heartlessness which voluntarily left the fondest of parents deprived of all female tending , to the charge of a hired nurse and an unskillful though willing youth like myself . That eternity might , in Miss Clinton 's absence , set a seal to the life of her father was a thought which in my indignation I was on the point of uttering , but I checked myself , unwilling to interfere too far in a matter which came not within my rightful province , and perhaps excite unnecessary alarm in Isabel . If selfishness mingled at all in my views , dear Gerty , and made me over-impatient for the return of the daughter to her post of duty , it was that I might be released from almost constant attendance upon my invalid friend , and hasten to her from whom I hoped such warmth of greeting as I was only eager to bestow .

But my position , sir , even as a child , was singular ; and excuse me if I briefly refer to it . I could not have been more than twelve or fourteen years of age when I began to realise the necessity which rested upon me . My widowed mother and her aged father were the only relatives I knew . One was feeble , delicate , and unequal to active exertion ; the other was old and poor , being wholly dependent upon a small salary for officiating as sexton of a neighbouring church . Yet in spite of these circumstances they maintained me for several years in comfort and decency , and gave me an excellent education . \" At an age when kites and marbles are so engrossing , I had an earnest desire to relieve my mother and grandfather of a part of their care and labour ; and I obtained a situation , in which I was well treated and well paid , and which I retained until the death of my excellent master . Then , for a time , I felt bitterly the want of employment , and became despondent ; a state of mind which was fostered by constant association with my desponding grandfather , who , having met with great disappointment in life , encouraged me not , but was ever hinting at the probability of my failing in every scheme for advancement . \" I have since thought his doubtings answered a good purpose ; for nothing so urged me on to efforts as the desire to prove the mistaken nature of his gloomy predictions , and few things have given me more satisfaction than the assurances I have received during the past few years that he came at last to a full conviction that my prosperity was established , and that one of his ill - fated family was destined to escape the trials of poverty . \" My mother was a quiet , gentle woman , small in person , with great simplicity , and some reserve of manner . She loved me like her own soul ; she taught me everything I know of goodness ; there is no sacrifice I would not have made for her happiness . I would have died to save her life ; but we shall never meet again in this world , and I -- I -- am learning to be resigned . \" For these two , and one other , whom I shall speak of presently , I was ready to go away , and strive , and suffer , and be patient . The opportunity came and I embraced it . And soon one great object of my ambition was won ; I was able to earn a competency for myself and for them . And I began to look forward to a day when my long looked - for return should render our happiness complete . I little thought then that the sad tidings of my grandfather 's death were on their way , and the news of my mother 's slow but sure decline so soon to follow . But they are both gone ; and I should now be so solitary as almost to long to follow them but for one other , whose love will bind me to earth so long as she is spared . \"",

      "text": "\" There lived in the same house which my grandfather occupied an old man , a city lamplighter . He was poorer even than we were , but there never was a better or a kinder - hearted person in the world . One evening , when engaged in his round of duty , he picked up and brought home a little ragged child , whom a cruel woman had thrust into the street to perish with cold , or die a more lingering death in the almshouse ; for nothing but such devoted care as she received from my mother and Uncle True ( so we always called our old friend ) could have saved the half - starved creature from the consequences of long exposure and ill - treatment . Through their unwearied watching and efforts she was spared , to repay in after years more than all the love bestowed upon her . She was then miserably thin , and plain in her appearance , besides being possessed of a violent temper , which she had never been taught to restrain , and a stubbornness which resulted from her having long lived in opposition to all the world . \" All this , however , did not repel Uncle True , under whose loving influence new virtues and capacities soon began to manifest themselves . In the atmosphere of love in which she now lived she soon became a changed being ; and when , in addition to the example and precepts taught her at home , a divine light was shed upon her life by one who , herself sitting in darkness , casts a halo forth from her own spirit to illumine those of all who are blessed with her presence , she became , what she has ever since been , a being to love and to trust for a lifetime . For myself , there were no bounds to the affection I soon came to cherish for the little girl , to whom I was first attracted by compassion merely . \" We were constantly together ; we had no thoughts , no studies , no pleasures , sorrows , or interests that were not shared . I was her teacher , her protector , the partner of all her childish amusements ; and she was by turns an advising and sympathising friend . In this latter character she was indispensable to me , for she had a hopeful nature , and a buoyancy of spirit which imparted itself to me . I well remember when my kind employer died , and I was plunged in grief and despair , the confidence and energy with which she , then very young , inspired me . The relation between her and Uncle True was beautiful . Boy as I was I could not but view with admiration the old man 's devoted love for the adopted darling of his latter years ( his birdie , as he always called her ) , and the grateful affection which she bore him in return . \" During the first few years she was wholly dependent upon him , and seemed only a fond , affectionate child ; but a time came at last when the case was reversed , and the old man , stricken with disease , became infirm and helpless . It was then that the beauty of her woman 's nature shone forth triumphant ; and , oh ! how gently , child as she was , she guided his steps as he descended to the grave . Often have I gone to his room at midnight , fearing lest he might be in need of care which she in her youth and inexperience would be unable to render ; and never shall I forget the little figure seated calmly by his bedside , at an hour when many of her years would be shrinking from fears conjured up by the night and the darkness , with a lamp dimly burning on a table before her , and she herself , with his hand in hers , sweetly soothing his wakefulness by her loving words , or with her eyes bent upon her little Bible , reading to him holy lessons . But all her care could not prolong his life ; and just before I went to India he died , blessing God for the peace imparted to him through his gentle nurse . \" It was my task to soothe our little Gerty 's sorrows , and do what I could to comfort her , an office which , before I left the country , I was rejoiced to transfer to the willing hands of the excellent blind lady who had long befriended both her and Uncle True . Before I went away , I solemnly committed to Gerty , who had in one instance proved herself both willing and able , the care of my mother and grandfather . She promised to be faithful to her trust ; and nobly was that promise kept . In spite of the unkindness and deep displeasure of Mr. Graham ( the blind lady 's father ) , upon whose bounty she had for a long time been dependent , she devoted herself heart and hand to the fulfilment of duties which in her eyes were sacred and holy . In spite of suffering , labour , watching , and privation , she voluntarily forsook ease and pleasure , and spent day and night in the patient service of friends whom she loved with a greater love than a daughter 's , for it was that of a saint . \"",

Mrs. Ellis , whom I had always treated with coldness , and often with disdain , nursed me by night and day with a care and devotion which I did not expect , and under her nursing , and the skilful treatment of Dr. Jeremy , I began to recover . One day , when I was able to be up and dressed for several hours at a time , I went for change of air and scene into my father 's library , and there lay half reclining upon the sofa . Mrs. Ellis had gone to attend to household duties , but before she left me she placed within my reach a small table , upon which were arranged various phials , glasses , etc. , and other things which I might require before her return . It was in an evening in June , and I lay watching the approach of sunset from an opposite window . I was oppressed , with a sad sense of loneliness , for during the past six weeks I had enjoyed no society but that of my nurse and periodical visits from my father ; and felt , therefore , no common pleasure when my most congenial but now nearly forbidden associate entered the room . He had not seen me since my illness , and after this protracted and painful separation our meeting was tender and affectionate . He had , with all the fire of a hot and ungoverned temper , a woman 's depth of feeling , warmth of heart , and sympathising sweetness of manner . Well do I remember the expression of his noble face , the manly tones of his voice , as , seated beside me on the wide couch , he bathed the temples of my aching head with eau - de-cologne , which he took from the table near by , at the same time expressing again and again his joy at once more seeing me . \" How long we had sat thus I can not tell , but the twilight was deepening in the room when we were suddenly interrupted by my father , who entered abruptly , came towards us with hasty steps , but stopping short when within a yard or two , confronted his step - son with such a look of angry contempt as I had never before seen upon his face . The latter rose and stood before him with a glance of proud defiance , and then ensued a scene which I have neither the wish nor power to describe . \" It is sufficient to say that in the double accusation which my excited parent now brought against the object of his wrath , he urged the fact of his seeking by mean , base , and contemptible artifice to win the affections , and with them the expected fortune , of his only child as a secondary and pardonable crime compared with his deeper , darker , and just but detected guilt of forgery -- forgery of a large amount , and upon his benefactor 's name . \" To this day , so far as I know , \"",

      "text": "\" it was this - a-way : Old man Blome bought this track about the time that Luellen Barton moved to her plantation . It mout ' a ' been sooner ; I ai n't sure . Barton -- leastways , what is Barton now -- belonged to old Simpson Barton . When he went south and married a rip - snortin ' widow , he brought his wife and a passel o ' niggers to live at the old home place . There had n't never been no niggers there , along of the fu ' st Mis ' Barton . \" When war broke out the niggers run away , along of Jerusalem Blome , that got up a nigger regimint . After the war there was talk of a railroad . It would run right through the Blome farm and cross the Barton place crossways . My daddy was overseer for Mis ' Barton . Simp did n't have nothin ' to say about the runnin ' of the place . I was a tyke , doin ' errands for everybody , and I heerd a lot o ' the railroad talk . Old Blome was sellin ' his farm in town lots , gettin ' ready for the boom -- for who would ' a ' thought that Mis ' Barton would turn her back on such a proposition ? \" You see , it was this - a-way : Mis ' Luellen was allus speculatin ' in niggers , and a month before war broke , she had bought a load of Guinea niggers -- the kind that looks like they are awearin ' bustles , you know . Simp kinder smelt war , but , Lordee , Luellen would n't be dictated to ! And she went broke , flat as a flitter . All that was left was the thousand acres of Barton land . \" Railroad ? No , siree ! She heard about old man Blome 's activity , and she had it in for Blome . She sat up and primped her lips when Pee - Dee Jones come in behalf of the railroad . That 's how the Barton Joneses come to settle in this neck o ' the woods . Pee - Dee Jones -- no kin o ' mine -- had a winnin ' way , and he purty nigh got Mis ' Luellen 's name on the paper , when he let slip that he intended buildin ' a town on her land . ' Do you think that I am agoin ' to have a lot of blue - bellied Yankees in my very dooryard ? ' she yelled . ' You are mistaken . ' And so she stuck . \" Afterwards she learned that Pee - Dee Jones had follered Grant . Whew ! She nigh busted with rage . Mis ' Luellen allus said that she could smell a Yankee a mile , and as she did n't like the smell , she cropped the railroad boom . It went five mile north of her place , and missed Bloomtown twenty mile . That 's why the two towns are just livin ' along . The folks that bought lots of old Blome tried to get another railroad to come their way . That was when the Wabash looked like it was headed for my farm ; but I reckon that opportunities like that do n't come but onct in a lifetime . \" I wonder that Mis ' Luellen 's spook do n't howl around Barton every night , for Jones bought the big house after she died , and the fambly comes back there to live whenever their luck goes wrong . Pee - Dee 's boy , Brons Jones , started a paper there , about the time that Hallam started the Bloomtown _ Herald _ . He sold out to a poor devil that 's racin ' to see if he can starve quicker 'n Ellis . Brons ai n't been around these parts , the last few years , but he owns a lot o ' Barton property that he thinks 'll make good some day . \"",

For ten years she lay , just as she fell , without visible signs of life . About twenty families existed , somehow . They had pigs , chickens and garden truck , and to all intents they would go on existing till the last trump . \" One day I went out into the country to attend a sale . Boys , I was never so well pleased with a day 's work as I was with that day 's jaunt . I heard the most masterly bit of eloquence that ever came from the lips of an auctioneer . The man had the crowd hypnotized . He even sold me an accordion , a thing I was born to hate . The fact that it was wind - broken and rattly never occurred to me until I woke up , after he had done . Then I went to him and said : \" ' You an auctioneer ! You should be in the Halls of Justice , telling the people how to interpret their laws . ' \" The idea struck him . He came into town with me and we talked the matter over . He was easily the best known and most liked man in the county . It was then that the political bug stung our good friend , Wat Harlow . Wat moved his family to town and soon he had a decent habitation . He stimulated a rain of paint and a hail of shingle nails . He prodded the older inhabitants to an era of wooden pavements and stone crossings . Bill 's grandfather objected , because he said it cut down the sale of rubber hip - boots ; but Wat 's eloquence was the key to fit anything that tried to lock the wheels of progress . He did more than that . He brought Jim Blanke from Leesburg to start a decent drug store . \" After that he robbed Barton of Tom Granger , and together they started the first bank of Bloomtown . Granger 's wife and baby , with Wat 's wife , were the civilization . Mrs. Granger was almost an invalid , even then , but she gathered the women together and formed an aid society . She begged and cajoled Bowers out of enough money to build a little church on the lot that Blome had donated . I joined the church , for the moral example . I do n't remember what denomination it was supposed to be . We had services once a month ; but Mrs. Granger was the real power in the town . She introduced boiled shirts and neckties . Tom bought the big patch of ground , north of the park , and set out those elm trees before his foundation was in . Then Jim Blanke got Otto Kraus to come here and start a private school . Otto played the little cabinet organ in church , and taught all the children music , after school hours . Thus was Bloomtown born . Wat Harlow made the blood circulate in her moribund veins . \"",

' and seem inclined to give in , that they become wonderfully brave , and shout and shriek and wave their scimitars . I was with the brave Captain Harman , aboard the twenty - six - gun ship _ Guernsey _ , with a crew of a hundred and ten men all told , when we fell in up the Straits with an Algerine man - of - war , carrying fifty guns and five hundred men , called the _ White Horse _ . She stood down upon us , under all sail , having the weather - gauge , and as soon as she got within gunshot began blazing away . Several times she attempted to board , but we drove back her cut - throat crew , though the rest of her people were blazing away at us with musketry from her poop and forecastle . I believe we should have taken her , but our captain received three musket balls in his body , and was nearly knocked over by a gunshot ; still he would not go below , and remained on deck till he sank from loss of blood . Our first lieutenant then took the command , and we continued engaging for another hour or more , till we had lost nine killed and three times as many wounded , for no one ever thought of giving in -- that meant having our throats cut or being carried off into slavery ; but at last the Algerine hauled off . Our rigging was too much cut about to allow us to follow , so she got away with the loss of not far short of a third of her crew , I suspect , from the number we saw hove overboard . Our brave captain died three days afterwards from the effects of his wounds , and the first lieutenant was promoted , as he deserved to be . Now , it is my belief that if we do not capture yonder craft , should she attack us , we may beat her off just as we did the _ White Horse _ . \"",

The little pocket - book was on the floor amongst other papers , but the list was not to be found in it . _ _ Am I mistaken ? Have I packed it in somewhere else , or , allowing for the fact that everything had been turned upside down , has this paper slipped among other papers , which would explain why I had not come across it again ? _ _ In spite of myself , I must confess to you that the thieves , I fancy , had only one aim in view when they entered my room , and that was to get hold of this list . _ _ What is your opinion ? _ _ I feel that perhaps I am about to show myself both inconsiderate and injudicious , but you know how miserable I am , and you will understand how the position I am in gives me grounds for being distracted . I am bent on talking this over with you , on knowing what you think of it .

Perhaps the Baroness intended to perform an act of charity , in this instance , before her supreme hour struck . Perhaps she miscalculated the effect of the poison she had taken , and so died in the house of the friend she had come to see and help : her death there could not have been her choice , for she must have known what serious trouble it would involve the artist in , were her dead body found in his studio . \" Here is the second hypothesis , which seems the more plausible . The Baroness de Vibray learns that she is ruined , she decides to die , and by chance or coincidence , which remains to be explained , for I have not the key to it yet , some third parties interested in her fate , learn her decision . They let her write to her lawyer ; they do not prevent her poisoning herself ; but , as soon as she is dead , they straightway take possession of her dead body and hasten to carry it to Jacques Dollon 's studio . To the painter himself they administered either with his consent or by force -- probably by force -- a powerful narcotic , so that when the police are called in next day they not only find the Baroness lying dead in the studio , but they also find the painter unconscious , close by his visitor . When Jacques Dollon is restored to consciousness , he is quite unable to give any sort of explanation of the tragedy ; naturally enough , the police look upon him as the murderer of her who was well known to have been his patroness ... .

My father lost everything he had in Sumner L. Delafield 's smash - up . I was fifteen years old then , and getting ready to go to Michigan University -- afterward I was to study law and be a prominent citizen . My father met Delafield first during a business trip to Boston -- we lived in central Illinois , and father was well - to - do -- and , just like everybody else , he gave the man his entire confidence . You remember , of course , how Delafield came to the top as a regular young Napoleon of business , and soon made a reputation as one of the big financiers . When he turned up missing one fine morning , and it was found that the bottom had dropped out of everything , most people believed he had killed himself . But he had n't , I happen to know , and he 's still alive . Well , my father had been so influenced by Delafield -- the fellow must have been a persuasive cuss -- that he had put everything he could raise into the man 's schemes , and had even mortgaged our home . He had a weak heart , and when he read the news of Delafield 's default and disappearance he fell out of his chair dead . The sudden shock of it all prostrated my mother , and she died in giving premature birth to a child . So there was I , a fifteen - year - old boy , suddenly dropped to the bottom of poverty , with two younger sisters and a little brother to take care of . \" I tell you , I swore vengeance on that man . I promised myself I 'd hunt him down if it took a lifetime . I 'm on his trail now , and I 'm not going to leave it until I run him into his hole . Then I 'm going to stand him up and call him to his face all he deserves ; and give him a gun , so he can have a fair chance for his worthless life , and take one myself ; and then I 'll put a bullet through his scoundrel brain if I have to hang for it afterward ! \"",

We missed long ago the clew that would have led us to success , in those gaps in his trail we never tried to fill , because we came upon his tracks again so easily a little later . While working on another case recently I had occasion to look through an omnibus bill passed years ago by an Arizona legislature . It contained an astonishing ruck of things , and among them was a section authorizing William J. Brown to change his name to Alexander Bancroft . I knew that William J. Brown was one of the names under which Delafield had once traded in mines down there , and that , when we next found him after he had dropped that name , it was as John Smith , when he went down into old Mexico with John Mason Hardy . This name of Bancroft , sandwiched in there , and with such pains to legalize it , when we had found no track of it elsewhere , made me prick up my ears . I looked deeper into the matter and found that he had used this name of Bancroft only when he went to visit his wife and daughter , who lived most of the time in San Francisco or Denver , and were known by that name . When last we had track of the man , before I ran across Rutherford Jenkins , it was , you will remember , as Henry C. Williams , and then we lost all trace of him . That was because he went then on a visit to his wife and daughter in Denver and stayed there for some months . He had made a good clean - up about that time and increased it by some lucky trading on the Denver stock exchange . Then he went to New Mexico , kept the name of Bancroft , engaged in other business as well as mining , and settled down to be a permanent citizen . \" I congratulate you upon the successful termination of our long chase . I understand Bancroft is a man of considerable property and I hope you will be able to make him disgorge some of the goods he stole so long ago . I have written this much hurriedly , just to give you an outline of my discoveries at once .
